The hackathon's theme revolved around Christmas festivities. We had 48 hours to design, code, and present a web application. Our team opted to develop a game aimed at adding excitement to your Christmas Eve.

Embracing our creativity, we approached this typically agreeable theme from a different angle. Dubbed after the infamous and mischievous character, the GRINCH GAME encourages you to disrupt your Christmas celebrations.

The game's mechanics involve presenting incomplete Christmas-themed sentences, which participants must fill in within a specified timeframe. The objective is to provide the most cynical responses possible to embody the Grinch persona. At the conclusion of each round, the participant with the most "Grinch-like" answer earns a point, while the one with the most Christmas-spirited response loses 1 point. The individual who finishes last must undertake a "spicy" penalty.

We receive the technical prize.
